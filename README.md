# KMeans_Clustering On Mall Customers Dataset

This project presents a detailed implementation and comparative analysis of the **K-Means clustering algorithm** using different initialization methods, including:
- **Random Initialization**
- **KMeans++ Initialization**
- **Max-Distance Initialization**

It was developed for educational and analytical purposes to study how initialization strategies impact the clustering results, convergence, and evaluation metrics such as **Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)** and **Silhouette Score**.
